<h1>Big Integer Class (C++)</h1>

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

This project is designed to create a class that can handle integer operations for larger numbers than the maximum value supported by the standard integer type.

These are the currently supported features and operations:

<ul>
  <li>Numbers with a maximum of 2<sup>64</sup>-1 digits</li>  
  <li>Addition</li>  
  <li>Subtraction</li>  
  <li>Multiplication</li>  
  <li>Equality Comparison (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)</li>  
  <li>I/O</li>
  <li>Copying numbers</li>  
</ul>
